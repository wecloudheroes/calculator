When designing applications for the cloud, **availability** is often just as important as performance and scalability. In Microsoft Azure, two key concepts help ensure that your workloads remain resilient and available: **Fault Domains (FDs)** and **Update Domains (UDs)**.

Although they sound similar, each solves a very different problem. Letâ€™s break them down.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Fault Domain (FD) â€“ Protecting Against Hardware Failures

A **Fault Domain** is a logical grouping of physical hardware in an Azure datacenter that shares a **common power source and network switch**.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as a **rack of servers**.

If that rack experiences a failure (power, network, or hardware), all VMs in that rack could go down.

**How Azure helps:**

* When you deploy VMs in an **Availability Set**, Azure automatically spreads them across **multiple Fault Domains**.
    
* This ensures that if one rack fails, your entire application doesnâ€™t go offline.
    

**Example:**

* VM1 â†’ FD1 (Rack 1)
    
* VM2 â†’ FD2 (Rack 2)
    
* If Rack 1 fails, VM2 is still available to serve users.
    

âœ… **Fault Domains protect against physical/hardware failures.**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Update Domain (UD) â€“ Protecting Against Planned Maintenance

Microsoft regularly updates the host infrastructure with patches, OS updates, and security fixes. During these **planned maintenance events**, VMs may need to be restarted.

If all your VMs were updated at once â†’ downtime!

**How Azure helps:**

* Azure divides your VMs into **Update Domains**.
    
* Updates are applied **one Update Domain at a time**.
    
* While VMs in UD1 are being updated (and may temporarily restart), VMs in UD2, UD3, etc., remain online.
    

**Example:**

* VM1 â†’ UD1
    
* VM2 â†’ UD2
    
* If Azure is patching UD1, only VM1 restarts while VM2 continues serving traffic.
    

âœ… **Update Domains protect against downtime during planned maintenance.**

## ðŸ”¹ Fault Domain vs Update Domain â€” The Key Difference

| Feature | Fault Domain (FD) ðŸš§ | Update Domain (UD) ðŸ”„ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protects Against | Physical hardware failure (rack, power, network) | Planned maintenance (patching, updates) |
| Grouping Basis | Common power & network | Update scheduling groups |
| Failure Type | Unplanned outage | Planned maintenance restart |
| Example | Rack-level power loss | Host OS update by Azure |
| Ensures | Hardware redundancy | Continuous availability during updates |

## ðŸ”¹ How They Work Together

When you create an **Availability Set**, you define:

* Number of **Fault Domains** (usually 2â€“3)
    
* Number of **Update Domains** (up to 20)
    

Azure then distributes your VMs across both.

**Example Scenario:**

* You deploy 4 VMs in an Availability Set with 2 FDs and 2 UDs.
    
* Azure might place them like this:
    
* VM1 â†’ FD1, UD1
    
* VM2 â†’ FD2, UD1
    
* VM3 â†’ FD1, UD2
    
* VM4 â†’ FD2, UD2
    

This way:

* If **Rack 1 (FD1) fails**, VMs in FD2 still run.
    
* If **UD1 is being updated**, VMs in UD2 still run.
    

ðŸ‘‰ Together, Fault Domains and Update Domains ensure resilience against **both unplanned failures** and **planned maintenance**.

## ðŸ”¹ Final Thoughts

High availability in Azure isnâ€™t just about having more servers â€” itâ€™s about **distributing them smartly** across both **Fault Domains** and **Update Domains**.

* **Fault Domains = Protection against hardware failure**
    
* **Update Domains = Protection against maintenance downtime**
    

By leveraging these concepts with **Availability Sets** or **Availability Zones**, you can design cloud-native applications that are resilient, reliable, and always ready to serve users.

ðŸ’¬ What about you? Do you design your workloads with Availability Sets, or have you shifted to **Availability Zones** for even stronger resilience?
