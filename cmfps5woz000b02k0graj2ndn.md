Azure Virtual Network (VNet) peering enables seamless connectivity between two VNets using **private IP addresses**, as if they were on the same network. This allows resources like VMs, databases, or services to communicate across VNets **without going over the public internet**, providing **low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity**.

VNet-to-VNet peering is commonly used for:

* Connecting workloads in **different VNets within the same subscription**
    
* Connecting workloads across **different subscriptions**
    
* Building **Hub-Spoke architectures**
    
* Enabling **hybrid connectivity** through a centralized VPN/ExpressRoute gateway

## üîπ Prerequisites Before Peering

1. **Non-overlapping IP address spaces**
    
    * Each VNet must have a unique CIDR block. Example:
        
        * Hub VNet ‚Üí 10.0.0.0/16
            
        * Spoke VNet ‚Üí 10.1.0.0/16
            
2. **Permissions**
    
    * You need **Network Contributor** or **Owner** rights on both VNets.
        
    * Cross-subscription peering requires approval from the other subscription.
        
3. **DNS Considerations**
    
    * Peered VNets do **not resolve private DNS names by default**.
        
    * Options: Use Azure DNS private zones linked to both VNets or configure custom DNS forwarders.
        
4. **Plan Gateway Transit (if hybrid connectivity needed)**
    
    * Hub VNet with VPN/ExpressRoute ‚Üí Enable **Allow Gateway Transit**
        
    * Spoke VNet ‚Üí Enable **Use Remote Gateway**

## üîπ Step-by-Step Implementation

### **Step 1: Create VNets**

* Hub VNet (shared services, gateway, firewall)
    
* Spoke VNet (workload-specific)
    
* Ensure non-overlapping **CIDR ranges**
    

### **Step 2: Configure Subnets**

* Hub VNet ‚Üí subnets for VPN/ExpressRoute, firewall, and applications
    
* Spoke VNet ‚Üí workload-specific subnets
    

### **Step 3: Create Peering from Hub to Spoke**

1. Go to **Hub VNet ‚Üí Peerings ‚Üí Add**
    
2. Configure:
    
    * Peering link name
        
    * **Remote VNet** ‚Üí select Spoke
        
    * Enable **Allow forwarded traffic** if using NVAs
        
    * Enable **Allow gateway transit** (if Hub has VPN/ExpressRoute)
        

### **Step 4: Create Peering from Spoke to Hub**

1. Go to **Spoke VNet ‚Üí Peerings ‚Üí Add**
    
2. Configure:
    
    * Peering link name
        
    * **Remote VNet** ‚Üí Hub
        
    * Enable **Use remote gateways**
        
    * Allow forwarded traffic if needed
        

### **Step 5: Configure NSGs and Route Tables**

* Ensure **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** allow required traffic between VNets
    
* Update **User Defined Routes (UDRs)** if traffic should flow through firewalls or NVAs
    

### **Step 6: Test Connectivity**

* Deploy VMs in both VNets and ping or use `Test-NetConnection`
    
* Ensure workloads can communicate on required ports

## üîπ Best Practices

1. **Avoid overlapping IP ranges** ‚Üí Critical for successful peering
    
2. **Hub-Spoke design** ‚Üí Reduces complexity and prevents ‚Äúspaghetti networking‚Äù
    
3. **DNS configuration** ‚Üí Use Private DNS zones or custom forwarders
    
4. **Transitive routing** ‚Üí Peering is non-transitive; use NVAs or Hub for controlled routing
    
5. **Regional considerations** ‚Üí Intra-region peering is free; cross-region incurs bandwidth cost
    
6. **Security** ‚Üí Use NSGs, Azure Firewall, or NVAs to restrict traffic as needed
    
7. **Monitoring & Cost Management** ‚Üí Track cross-region traffic usage

## üîπ Common Scenarios

### **1\. Hub-Spoke Architecture**

* Hub VNet ‚Üí shared firewall, VPN/ExpressRoute gateway
    
* Spokes ‚Üí isolated workloads
    
* Benefits: scalable, secure, and centrally managed
    

### **2\. Cross-Subscription Peering**

* Useful for multi-team or multi-department setups
    
* Requires approval from the remote subscription
    
* Same principles as standard peering, with attention to permissions
    

### **3\. Hybrid Connectivity**

* Spokes use Hub‚Äôs VPN or ExpressRoute gateway
    
* Reduces duplication of expensive network resources

## üîπ Diagram Example

```plaintext
       [ Hub VNet ]
     /       |       \
    /        |        \
[Spoke1]  [Spoke2]  [Spoke3]
     \       |       /
      \      |      /
        VPN / ExpressRoute
             |
        On-Premises
```

* All spokes connect to the Hub
    
* Hub provides shared services, security, and hybrid connectivity
    
* Peering ensures low-latency communication

## üîπ Final Thoughts

VNet-to-VNet peering is a **powerful tool for connecting workloads securely and efficiently** in Azure. By following these steps and best practices, you can:

* Achieve **low-latency connectivity**
    
* Maintain **network security and governance**
    
* Optimize costs and simplify management
    
* Avoid common pitfalls like **overlapping IPs or misconfigured gateways**
    

Peering, when combined with **Hub-Spoke architecture**, is the backbone of scalable, enterprise-grade Azure networking.
