Happy New Year everyone! This is my first blog post of 2025, and I'm super excited to share what I'll be focusing on this year: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (GenAI) in everyday projects. I'm talking about bringing these powerful tools into our daily routines, making things easier and more creative, one small project at a time.

I've always been fascinated by AI, and now that LLMs are becoming more accessible, it feels like the perfect time to dive in. I'm not aiming for complex research or cutting-edge algorithms (at least not yet!). My goal is to explore how we can use readily available tools to make a real difference in our day-to-day lives.

So, where to start? Well, I've decided to kick things off with a fantastic tool already available in the cloud market: **Azure OpenAI**.

**Why Azure OpenAI?**

Think of Azure OpenAI as a gateway to some seriously impressive AI brains. It gives us access to powerful language models developed by OpenAI (like GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4) within the secure and scalable environment of Microsoft Azure. This means we can use these models for all sorts of cool things, like:

* **Writing different kinds of creative content:** Poems, stories, scripts, even code!
    
* **Translating languages:** Breaking down language barriers with ease.
    
* **Answering questions in a helpful way:** Like having a super-smart research assistant at your fingertips.
    

The best part? It's ready to use *right now*. No need to build everything from scratch. That's exactly the kind of practical, hands-on approach I'm aiming for this year.

**My Learning Journey (and You're Invited!)**

I'm starting my Azure OpenAI journey as a beginner, just like many of you might be. And I'm going to share everything I learn along the way. Think of this blog as a personal logbook of my explorations, filled with tips, tricks, and maybe even a few stumbles (we all learn from those, right?).

Here’s the plan:

1. **Microsoft Learn is My New Best Friend:** Microsoft provides excellent free learning paths and modules specifically for Azure OpenAI. This is where I'll be building my foundation. The "Get started with Azure OpenAI Service" learning path is my first stop. (Search for it on Microsoft Learn for the most up-to-date link.)
    
2. **Getting Hands-On with Quickstarts:** Theory is great, but nothing beats practical experience. I'll be working through the quickstart guides to deploy models and make my first API calls. This is where the magic happens! You can find them here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart)
    
3. **Exploring and Experimenting:** Once I’ve got the basics down, I’ll be diving into different models, playing with parameters, and seeing what these AI brains can really do.
    
4. **Small Projects, Big Learning:** The real fun (and learning) comes from building small projects. I'm thinking chatbots, text summarizers, maybe even a creative writing assistant. I'll be sharing these projects here, so you can follow along and even try them yourself.
    

**Key Concepts I'll Be Focusing On:**

* **Prompts:** Learning how to ask the right questions to get the best results from the models.
    
* **Tokens:** Understanding how tokens work and how they relate to usage and cost.
    
* **API Calls:** Getting comfortable with making API calls to interact with the models.
    
* **Model Parameters:** Learning how to fine-tune the models' behavior using different parameters.
    

**Join Me on This Adventure!**

I'm genuinely excited to embark on this LLM and GenAI journey in 2025. I believe these tools have the potential to transform how we work, create, and interact with the world. And I'm even more excited to share this experience with you.

So, if you're curious about LLMs, GenAI, or just looking for some practical, hands-on projects to try, stick around! Let's explore this exciting world together. I'll be posting regular updates, sharing my learnings, and hopefully inspiring you to start your own AI adventures. Let's make 2025 the year we bring AI into our daily lives!
